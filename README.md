#### 4) How does destructuring assignment work in ES6?

ANS:

#### 5) Explain template literals in ES6. How are they different from string concatenation?

ANS:
Template literals (or template strings) are a new way to create strings in ES6 using backticks (`) instead of single or double quotes.
String Interpolation: You can embed variables and expressions directly inside a string using the ${variable} syntax. This is far cleaner and more readable than using the + operator to join pieces of a string.
Multi-line Strings: Template literals can span multiple lines without needing special characters like \n. This is especially useful for creating formatted text.
